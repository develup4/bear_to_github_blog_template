# F.I.R.S.T  
(FAST, INDEPENDENT, REPEATABLE, SELF VALIDATING, TIMELY)   
* Fast: Tests should be fast enough that you won’t be discouraged   
from using them.   
  
* Independent: Tests should not depend on the state of the previous test.   
  
* Repeatable: Tests should be repeatable in any environment without varying results.   
  
* Self-validating: Each test will have a single Boolean output of pass or fail.   
  
* Timely: Unit tests should be written just before the production   
  
code that makes the test pass.
