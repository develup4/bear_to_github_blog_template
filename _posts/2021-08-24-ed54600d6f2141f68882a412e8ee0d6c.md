Well...I live in an apartment now. We have 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a big kitchen in my apartment. My favorite room would have to be my bedroom. I spend most of my time there. Actually, I don't have a lot of furniture but I have everything I need. When I'm in my room, I usually relax in my bed, watch Youtube or read books. My room is not huge but it's the perfect place to relax.

When I was young, I used to live in a small house with my family. That time, I didn't have my room, so I had to share one with my brother. You know, it was very uncomfortable.

You know, I can listen to music whenever I want to, talk to friends...it feels great that I can do whatever I want.

Like I said earlier, there's a lot to do at the beach. First and all the beach is the perfect place to beat the heat. I like to relax under the sun and listen to music. it's so peaceful. I can forget all worries. In the evening, I can dine out at one of the restaurants out there. There are so many kinds of restraurants, you name it. Plus, you can see street performances along the beach if you're lucky. They play pretty good music out there. The beach is always active and I like the atmosphere.

I remember this one time I went to the beach in LA. I was traveling in LA for my summer vacation. And I wanted to go to a local beach. When I got there, I jumped into water immediately. However, I heard people screaming somewhere. So I went there to find out what was going on. Guess what? Lebron James was there. He was making a commercial. I couldn't believe my eyes. He was so gorgeous and my heart was beating so fast. When he was done, I asked a autograph and took pictures with him. I can never forget that day.

There are so many movie theaters in my city. My favorite theater is CGV. It's close to my apartment. It takes only 10 minutes. I like this movie theater because they are multiflex theater and comfortable seats. And also, they have 3D and 4D movies as well. It's more entertaining. So, CGV is my favorite.

There are so many good actors out there. I can't just pinpoint one. But if I pick one, I'd say Brad Pitt. I can't think of any bad movie he is in. He did great roles in many movies like Money Ball or Big short. I can't wait for his next movie. So, yeah. Brad Pitt is my favorite.
