## General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns  
### Craig Larman’s 9 principles  
  
Information Expert  
 Creator  
 Controller  
 Low Coupling  
 High Cohesion  
 Polymorphism  
 Pure Fabrication  Indirection  
 Protected variations  
  
  
### Create design model  
• Add attributes and methods to the software classes  
• Define the interactions between the objects  
 Okay, I got it. But, how ???  
 GRASP  
 will guide you how to assign responsibilities to collaborating objects  
  
  
### Responsibility  
A responsibility is not the same as a method,  
but methods are implemented to fulfil responsibilities.  
  
하나의 책임이 여러개의 메소드에 의해 구현될 수 있다. 예를 들어 하나의 퍼블릭 인터페이스와 거기서 호출하는 여러개의 프라이빗 메소드  
  
  
## 9 principle  
### Modularity  
 Goal of design  
 partition the system into modules and assign responsibility among the  
components  
 Modularity reduces the total complexity a programmer has to deal with at any one time:  
 functions are assigned to modules in a way that groups similar functions together (Separation of Concerns), and  
 there are small, simple, well-defined interfaces between modules (Information Hiding)  
**Measuring Modularity(측정방법)**  
 Coupling: measure of the inter-dependencies between modules  
 Cohesion: measure of how strongly the elements in a module are related  
  
#### Common forms of coupling in OO languages  
TypeX depends on TypeY if  
 TypeX has an attribute referencing a TypeY instance, or TypeY itself.  
 TypeX has a method referencing a TypeY instance, or TypeY itself, by any means. (e.g. a parameter or local variable of type TypeY, or the returned object is an instance of TypeY, etc) **파라메터 지역변수 리턴값 등에 어떤 타입을 사용한다면 그것은 커플링이다.**  
 TypeX is a direct or indirect subclass of TypeY.  TypeX implements interface TypeY.  
  
  
#### Concept of Cohesion  
 Cohesion  
 measure of how strongly the elements in a class (module) are related  the related responsibilities are placed into one manageable unit.  
 **related to Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
Pursue High Cohesion!  
 Advantages of High Cohesion  
 Easily understandable and maintainable  Code reuse  
 Low coupling
