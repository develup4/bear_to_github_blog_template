Well...I live in an apartment now. We have 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a big kitchen in my apartment. My favorite room would have to be my bedroom. I spend most of my time there. Actually, I don't have a lot of furniture but I have everything I need. When I'm in my room, I usually relax in my bed, watch Youtube or read books. My room is not huge but it's the perfect place to relax.  
```

Well...actually I don't do anything special. Most of the time, I do house chores like washing the dishes, cleaning or doing laundry and stuff. If I don't have anything to do, I go to Youtube and watch videos. Youtube has everything you could ask for. It can be very entertaining. So, that's it.

When I was young, I used to live in a small house with my family. That time, I didn't have my room, so I had to share one with my brother. You know, it was very uncomfortable. But now, we moved to a big apartment, so I have my own bedroom. It's nice that I have my space. You know, I can listen to music whenever I want to, talk to friends...it feels great that I can do whatever I want.

 Well...You know, I changed the wallpaper last weekend. Because my wallpaper was too old and the color got faded. Last weekend, I went to a store and picked out new wallpaper. You know what? There was a wide range of selections, so it was hard to choose one. Anyway, when we got home, we put up the now wallpaper in my bedroom. Actually, I love the color and design.

```  
Um...Give me a second, please. honestly I've never had any big problems in my house. You know, if something's broken, I usually call a building manager. However, if it's a minor problem, I fix it myself. There was one time when my toilet was backed up, I used the plunger to fix it. It did wonders. That was the only problem in the house.
